# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch


This Python program showcases a fundamental approach to binary classification using logistic regression and gradient descent optimization. The program is made from scratch using the algorithms itself. The script is designed to generate a synthetic dataset, apply logistic regression techniques, and utilize gradient descent for parameter optimization.

Highlights:

Dataset Creation: Automatic generation of a synthetic dataset using normal distribution.

Logistic Regression Model: Implementation of logistic regression, a core machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks.
Gradient Descent Optimization: Incorporation of gradient descent, a powerful optimization technique, to refine model parameters.
Model Evaluation: Functionality to assess the model's performance through predictions and accuracy calculations.
This program is an illustrative example of applying logistic regression to a binary classification problem, making it a valuable resource for learners and practitioners in data science and machine learning. It demonstrates the essentials of model training, optimization, and evaluation in a concise and understandable format.
